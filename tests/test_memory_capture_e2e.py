"""The capture pipeline, end to end, on a database that is really written.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM THE EXTRACTOR TESTS
--------------------------------------------------------
``tests/test_memory_extraction_v2.py`` asks a pure function what it proposes.
That is necessary and it is not enough: the audit that prompted this work found
a machine with 177 messages and zero memories, and every extractor test on it
was green. An extractor that proposes the right thing proves nothing about a
pipeline that never calls it, drops the write, or indexes it somewhere
retrieval cannot see.

So nothing here calls ``extract`` directly. Each test posts a message the way
the application does — ``record_user_message`` on a real ``MemoryStack`` over a
real SQLite file — and then asks the questions the user would ask: is it in the
store, does it come back when I need it, is it still there after a restart.

``background=False`` is used throughout so the deferred capture job runs where
the assertion can see it. That is the only concession to testability: the code
path, the schema, the safety gate and the retrieval index are the production
ones.

THE DATABASE IS ALWAYS A TEMPORARY ONE
--------------------------------------
``memory_module.DB_PATH`` is redirected to ``tmp_path`` before any engine is
constructed, so no test in this file can reach the user's real ``helios.db``.
Every message posted here is synthetic and written by these tests.
