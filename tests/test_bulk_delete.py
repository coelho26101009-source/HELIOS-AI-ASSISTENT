"""Bulk conversation deletion: the backend operation and its reporting.

SPLIT OUT OF ``test_auto_memory.py`` ON PURPOSE. These tests exercise
``MemoryStack.delete_conversations``, ``ConversationStore.delete_many`` and the
``delete_conversations`` bridge endpoint — the bulk-delete work, which is a
different change from the Memory / Second Brain one and ships separately. Left
in the memory module they would have made that module fail to import against a
tree without the bulk endpoint, which is exactly the coupling this file exists
to remove.

The fixture is duplicated rather than shared through a conftest: the two files
are meant to be independent, and a shared fixture would put the coupling back
one level down.
