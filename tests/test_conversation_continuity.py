"""THE THREAD THAT STARTS A TURN OWNS THE WHOLE TURN.

The defect these lock out was silent and destructive. Nano answers on an event
loop, but the conversation rail (`open_conversation`, `create_conversation`)
is served on eel's bridge thread and moves the active-thread pointer the moment
the user clicks. Persistence used to resolve "which thread does this belong to"
LAZILY -- once when the question was stored and again when the answer finished
-- so a user who sent a message and then opened another conversation had the
reply written into whichever thread happened to be active at the end.

Measured before the fix, through the real `send_message` path:

    THREAD A: []
    THREAD B: [('user', 'pergunta na conversa A'), ('assistant', 'resposta')]

The whole turn moved. Thread A kept nothing; thread B, which the user had
merely glanced at, gained a question it was never asked. Reopening A showed an
empty conversation, and B's history was a lie.

These are behavioural tests. Each drives the real `core.main` code path against
a real MemoryStack over a throwaway SQLite database and reads back what the
database actually contains. Nothing greps source: the bug was not visible in
the source of any single line, only in the interleaving.

UI VISIBILITY AND PERSISTENCE ARE SEPARATE CONCERNS, and these tests only
assert the second. What the user is looking at while the answer streams is the
renderer's business; where the answer is STORED is not negotiable.
