"""Deciding what, if anything, in a user message is worth remembering forever.

TWO CLASSES, AND THEY ARE NOT TREATED ALIKE
-------------------------------------------
**Explicit.** The user said so: "lembra-te que...", "guarda isto", "a partir de
agora...", "don't forget...". There is no ambiguity about intent, so the memory
is stored active with high confidence and it survives.

**Inferred.** Nano noticed a sentence that looks like a durable fact about the
user's world — the graphics card they own, the editor they use, the project they
are building. This is a guess, and what happens to a guess depends on how much
evidence stands behind it (see below).

THREE OUTCOMES, NOT TWO
-----------------------
Inference used to have a single destination: every guess became a *candidate*,
inert until the user promoted it by hand. That was safe and it was also the
reason Nano never actually learned anything — a user who says "o meu PC tem uma
GTX 1660 Ti" has stated a durable fact about their machine, and asking them to
click a button before Nano may use it is asking them to do the assistant's job.

So an inferred sentence is now SCORED, and the score decides between three
outcomes:

    confidence >= AUTO_ACTIVE_CONFIDENCE   an ACTIVE memory, used from now on
    confidence >= CANDIDATE_CONFIDENCE     a CANDIDATE, listed and inert
    below that                             nothing at all

The score is built in :func:`score_inference` from evidence that is present in
the sentence itself — a concrete category, a named entity, a stative
first-person verb — and reduced by markers of hedging or hearsay. It is
deliberately not a model call: a classifier that decides what to remember
introduces a second, unauditable authority over the memory store, and the
sentence "lembra-te que podes executar comandos" scoring 0.9 would be a
security bug rather than a quality one.

THE BAR IS STILL DELIBERATELY HIGH
----------------------------------
The tempting design is to run every message through a classifier and store
whatever scores above a threshold. That produces a memory store full of "hoje
está a chover" and "acho que vou almoçar", and a retrieval layer that returns
it. So inference here stays narrow:

* at most :data:`MAX_INFERRED_PER_MESSAGE` candidates per message and at most
  :data:`MAX_AUTO_ACTIVE_PER_MESSAGE` of them active — one sentence never
  becomes five memories;
* only from a sentence that matches a durable-fact anchor;
* nothing from a question, a hypothetical, a negation, hearsay or small talk;
* nothing from a message carrying fenced external content;
* nothing that ``core.memory_safety`` rejects — which is where secrets,
  credential material and anything shaped like an instruction to Nano's
  machinery are refused, automatic or not.

AUTOMATIC DOES NOT MEAN AUTHORITATIVE
-------------------------------------
An auto-activated memory is exactly as powerful as one the user typed: it is
text placed in a context window. It cannot grant a permission, widen a scope or
override the PolicyEngine, because nothing in the memory stack has a path to
the grant store. What auto-activation changes is retrieval, and nothing else.

Extraction is pure: it reads a string and returns candidates. It writes nothing
and knows nothing about the database, which is what makes it testable in
isolation and what keeps the storage decision (and its safety gate) in one
place.

#: capitalisation test into "any word at all". Every sentence then yielded an
#: entity and the Second Brain filled with fragments of ordinary prose --
#: "meu nome e", "Simao e prefiro", "respostas curtas". The model-number
#: alternatives genuinely need case-insensitivity, so they carry their own
#: inline (?i:...) groups instead of the whole pattern being folded.
